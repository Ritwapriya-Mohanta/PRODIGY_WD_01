This repository is about a stop-watch web application that is made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML is used to structure the elements of the application. By implementing functions for starting, pausing, and resetting the stopwatch, as well as tracking and displaying lap times, users can accurately measure and record time intervals. With these technologies and functionalities, I have created an interactive and user-friendly stopwatch web application.
